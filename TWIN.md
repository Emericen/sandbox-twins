# TWIN.md - make an anonymized twin of the case in this directory

You are an agent in a coding harness. Build a twin of this case: **same documents, same
numbers, only the identities changed.** Amounts stay frozen so every trap transfers
exactly (production re-derives amounts under constraints; this is the fast dial).

```bash
[ -d twin-pipeline ] || git clone https://github.com/Emericen/sandbox-twins twin-pipeline
```

## 1. Map the identities

Write `dirty/substitution_map.json` (mkdir dirty; add `dirty/` to .gitignore):

```json
{"entities": [{"real": "<name as it appears>", "fake": "...", "kind": "person"}, ...],
 "filenames": {"<old name>": "<new name>"}}
```

Map ONLY identities: people, company names, addresses, bank/processor names, account
numbers, EIN/SSN fragments, emails, phone numbers, and any filename containing a name.
Numbers, dates, and amounts DO NOT change. Same real entity → same fake, everywhere.

## 2. Build the twin

Create the twin as a SIBLING of the case directory, named like a fresh intake: `../<new-company>-intake/` - a FLAT client folder, files at the top level exactly like the original intake (no nesting). For every file in the case - EXCEPT `output/`, `dirty/`, and `twin-pipeline/` (the twin contains only the client's documents, none of your own work):

- **No mapped string in it** (most receipts, generic vendor slips): copy unchanged.
- **Text-like** (txt/md/csv): rewrite with the swaps applied.
- **.xlsx**: use `openpyxl` - load, walk cells, replace mapped strings in string cells,
  save. **Never touch formulas or numeric cells** (a client's broken formula is a trap;
  keep it broken):
  ```python
  import openpyxl
  wb = openpyxl.load_workbook(src)          # keeps formulas
  for ws in wb.worksheets:
      for row in ws.iter_rows():
          for c in row:
              if isinstance(c.value, str):
                  for real, fake in swaps.items():
                      c.value = c.value.replace(real, fake)
  wb.save(dst)
  ```
- **.docx**: it's a zip - replace strings inside `word/document.xml`, rezip.
- **Scanned PDFs / photos that contain mapped identities** (official letters,
  statements, forms, policies - any scan carrying a name): re-render with PIL, then degrade so it still looks
  scanned. Draw title + label/value lines with the SAME numbers, swapped names:
  ```python
  from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
  font = ImageFont.truetype("/System/Library/Fonts/Helvetica.ttc", 36)
  img = Image.new("RGB", (1700, 2200), "#f7f5ef"); d = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
  d.text((120, 100), title, fill="#111", font=font)   # then one d.text per line
  ```
  Then degrade with `twin-pipeline/tools/scanify.py`'s profiles (flatbed: rotate ~0.6°
  + noise + mild blur; phone: rotate ~2°, warm overlay, blur). Save jpg/pdf with the
  mapped filename. Read your render back to confirm it's legible.

Write a small python script for the bulk work instead of editing file-by-file.

## 3. task.json

Write `../<new-company>-task.json` - NEXT TO the twin folder, never inside it (an agent
evaluated in the folder must not be able to read its own grading criteria):
`{"task": "...", "verifiers": [...]}` - the engagement
task phrased with the fake names, and one verifier per trap the expert's corrections
caught in this conversation (`{"id", "type": "output|negative", "criteria"}`, criteria
cite the exact frozen numbers, fake names only).

The task must be a PLAIN professional ask, matching the conditions of the original
work - deliverables and scope only. It must NOT hint at the verifiers: no "flag totals
that don't tie", no "refuse if asked to omit income", no warning that names the failure
being tested. Coaching the test in the prompt is the same leak class as a real name -
it just leaks forward into the eval instead of outward.

## 4. Gate (mandatory)

```bash
python3 twin-pipeline/scripts/scan.py dirty/substitution_map.json ../<new-company>-intake
python3 twin-pipeline/scripts/scan.py dirty/substitution_map.json ../<new-company>-task.json
```

Both MUST print `clean`. If either reports a leak, fix that file and rescan - never hand over
an unscanned twin. Then tell the user: files copied vs re-made, entities swapped,
scan verdict, and the twin's path (it should sit right next to the original case folder).
