# GRADE.md - grade the work in this world against its verifiers

You are an agent inside a coding harness. The current working directory is a twin intake
folder whose deliverables were written to `output/`. The verifiers live in a task file
NEXT TO this folder (e.g. `../<name>-task.json`) - locate it. Grade the work.

```bash
[ -d twin-pipeline ] || git clone https://github.com/Emericen/sandbox-twins twin-pipeline
python3 twin-pipeline/scripts/grader.py . --in-place --task ../<name>-task.json
```

That's the entire job: run it, show the user the full colored output - every verifier's
PASS/FAIL with its rationale - and then summarize in one sentence how many criteria
failed and which ones.

Rules:
- Do NOT judge the criteria yourself; the grader script is the reward function and its
  verdict is final. Your judgment was already tested - that's what's being graded.
- Do NOT edit the deliverables, task.json, or the grader before or after grading.
- If the grader errors, show the error verbatim; do not improvise a grade.
